# Embedded systems final assignment.
This repository is the repository for my final assignment for the module embedded systems that is part of the minor Smart Embedded systems.
## Introduction.
I recently watched a series of videos on youtube about building your own 8-bit CPU on breadboards. It was really interesting watching the videos and really learning how a CPU in essence works. The videos are by [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/8bit). Building the CPU myself on breadboard seemed a little costly and ambitious. I decided I want to remake the CPU in vhdl as a final assignment for Embedded System.

The goal is to be able to completely simulate the CPU and, if possible, make it run on a DE10-nano board. I will try to make the CPU in the same order as the video series on Youtube. In this repository I will describe my findings and place the VHDL code.
